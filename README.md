# Exploratory Data Analysis on Mental Health Dataset

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world mental health dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to the prevalence of mental illnesses across countries and years.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Mental Health dataset from Kaggle**, focusing on the file:
- `mental-illnesses-prevalence.csv`

The dataset provides country-level prevalence statistics for different mental health conditions over time.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Summary statistics
- Trend analysis over time
- Data visualization across countries and years

## Missing Values
The dataset contains missing values only in the `Code` column, which represents country codes.
Since this column is not required for analysis, it was removed. All remaining columns contain
complete data.

## Outcome
Identified key patterns in mental illness prevalence, observed variations across countries, and analyzed temporal trends that highlight changes in mental health prevalence over time.
